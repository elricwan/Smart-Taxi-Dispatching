# Data-Incubator-project
This is the proposal for the project.


Modern urbanization is demanding high-efficiency taxi services to satisfy the request of taxi users as well as the 
expectation of drivers. Customers desire to wait the minimum time before finding a taxi, while drivers aim to maximize their
profits by speeding up their customer hunting. In this project, we propose to exploit the benefits of vehicular social network by
enabling data exchange and more cooperation among regular taxi drivers. The objective is to design a smart recommendation system
allowing drivers to optimize three key performance metrics: number of pickups, customer waiting time, and vacant travel
distance. The proposed recommendation starts by efficiently estimating the future customer demands in the different region
of interest. Then, it proposes an optimal taxi-to-region matching according to the current location of each taxi and the requested
demand. Finally, an optimized routing algorithm is proposed to allow taxi drivers reach their destinations faster. 

In short, the most important steps include: predict the future demand in each regions, and optimally assign taxis to the regions 
by the ratio.

For the Advanced part, we may re-allocate the regions by clustering the position of customers at different time stamp.
